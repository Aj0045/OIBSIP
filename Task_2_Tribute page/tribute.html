                    <p>
                        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                        Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press
                        Information
                        Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                        Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                        unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
                        Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S.
                        Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).In 1969, Kalam
                        was
                        transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director
                        of
                        India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini
                        satellite in
                        near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
                        independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the
                        programme to include more engineers.

                    <p>
                        In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space
                        Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s,
                        Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects,
                        both of which proved to be successful.

                    Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                    presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by
                    Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.

                    On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time,
                    expressed
                    that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,and both the Samajwadi Party and
                    the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.After the Samajwadi Party announced its
                    support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.

                <p>
                    On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and
                    his senior Cabinet colleagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state
                    assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was
                    a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic
                    of India in an easy victory,and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.
                    Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                    civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Hussain
                    (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India.He was
                    also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.
